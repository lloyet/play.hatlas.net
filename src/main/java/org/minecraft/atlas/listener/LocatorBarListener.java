/**
 * Restricts the 1.21.6+ locator bar so a player only ever sees markers for members of
 * their own faction. Vanilla broadcasts every player's waypoint to everyone in the same
 * dimension; there is no per-viewer Bukkit API, so we intercept the clientbound
 * {@code WAYPOINT} packet (via packetevents) and cancel it whenever the transmitter is
 * not in the viewer's faction.
 *
 * <p>Only TRACK/UPDATE operations are filtered; UNTRACK always passes. Cancelling them
 * means a disallowed marker is never shown on the receiving client. Because we only filter outbound packets, faction membership changes
 * must call {@link #refresh(Collection)} so markers that were already sent (or cancelled)
 * are re-evaluated against the new faction state.
